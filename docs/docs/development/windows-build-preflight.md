# Windows build preflight

The Windows build preflight catches selected MSVC and DLL-boundary regressions
before a complete Windows build. It is a fast diagnostic layer, not a
replacement for building and testing the application.

## Source checks

The dependency-free check and its self-tests run on Windows or Linux with
Python 3.10 or newer:

```sh
python tools/windows_build_preflight.py --source-only
```

It checks a source contract that otherwise tends to fail only when the Windows
test executable is linked: a non-inline visualizer free function explicitly
imported or fully qualified by a test must declare `LFS_VIS_API` so it is
present in the DLL import library.

The rule is intentionally conservative. It ignores broad `using namespace`
imports, class methods, inline functions, and `constexpr` helpers rather than
guessing at C++ semantics.

In particular, `tests/test_project_lifecycle.cpp` and
`tests/test_p5_session_chapters.cpp` use unqualified calls after nested
`using namespace` directives. Removing `LFS_VIS_API` from
`capturePanelCameraProjectState` is not detected by this source-only rule.
The Windows link step is still needed to catch that missing export.

Run the checker self-tests after changing its matching rules. The shader-target
regression fixture additionally needs CMake and Ninja. It
uses a project with no enabled compiler languages and a simulated header
generator; it does not build LichtFeld or compile C++, CUDA, or GLSL.

```sh
python -m unittest tests/python/test_windows_build_preflight.py tests/python/test_shader_header_target.py
```

## Configured MSVC check

For compiler-level coverage, first configure the normal Ninja/MSVC build so
that `compile_commands.json` exists. From the same Visual Studio developer
environment used for the build, prepare the generated shader headers and then
run the checker:

```powershell
cmake --build build --target lfs_shader_headers --config Release -j 4
python tools/windows_build_preflight.py `
  --compile-commands build/compile_commands.json `
  --changed-since upstream/master
```

The tool follows project-local quoted and angle-bracket includes from each changed header to the
affected C and C++ translation units. It then replays their existing commands
with MSVC's `/Zs` option. The Microsoft compiler therefore parses the same
sources with the configured defines and include paths, but does not generate
object files or link targets. Compiler-specific failures such as invalid use of
an incomplete type belong to this authoritative configured check, not to a
lexical Python rule.

Keep `compile_commands.json` in its original configured build directory. The
include index also considers headers under that directory's `include/`, so the
generated `config.h` does not alias Vulkan's private header of the same name.
Only project and generated headers are resolved; system headers are excluded.
Deleted headers and both sides of a rename participate in change discovery.
Changed paths are limited to `src/`, `include/`, and `tests/`, and the selected
compile database's build directory is excluded, even if it is named `b/` or
located under a source directory. Generated files remain available to resolve
includes but do not count as source edits.

Configuration provides the ABI stamp and configuration headers. Shader headers
such as `viewport/frustum.vert.spv.h` are build outputs: `lfs_shader_headers`
runs their existing CMake dependencies, including the shader compiler helper,
without building the visualizer or application. Use the configuration matching
the compile database; for a multi-config database, prepare each configuration
that will be replayed. The normal Windows and nightly CI workflows run this
prerequisite before the configured preflight and stop if generation fails.
An unchanged header is reused by the subsequent full build.

The Python checker itself reads the compile database and existing headers; it
does not configure CMake, parse its cache, or run build targets. Syntax-only
replay bypasses `sccache` and removes `/showIncludes`,
`/Yc`, `/Yu`, and `/Fp` (including PCH filenames). It does not require a PCH build.

Build-system-only changes do not replay every translation unit automatically:
that would duplicate most of a full build and defeat the purpose of a fast
preflight. Add `--all-commands` when a change to CMake options or compile
definitions genuinely requires a complete configured syntax pass.

Use `--max-commands N` to impose a finite work budget. If a broad header change
exceeds that budget, the configured replay is skipped explicitly and the
normal full build remains authoritative. GitHub Actions also receives a
`::warning::` annotation so a green step does not hide the skipped replay.
This prevents the preflight from
adding an almost complete second compilation pass. Runs are unlimited by
default. `--all-commands` covers C/C++ sources under `src/`, `include/`, and
`tests/`; vendored, generated, `_deps`, and vcpkg sources are excluded.

In Windows PR CI, the default merge checkout is compared with `HEAD^1`, the
current target-branch parent. This excludes changes that arrived independently
on master. Push builds use the event's previous commit.

Before invoking MSVC, the configured pass lists every selected source using a
repository-relative path. The headline count refers to compile-database
commands; if the same source has more than one entry, the source list groups it
once and annotates the number of commands. This makes unexpectedly broad
selection visible without printing compiler command lines or machine-specific
paths.

Use the portable build directory to check portable compile definitions:

```powershell
cmake --build build-portable --target lfs_shader_headers --config Release -j 4
python tools/windows_build_preflight.py `
  --compile-commands build-portable/compile_commands.json `
  --changed-since upstream/master
```

Use `--dry-run` to inspect the selected translation units without invoking the
compiler, or `--all-commands` when a complete configured
C/C++ syntax pass is needed:

```powershell
python tools/windows_build_preflight.py `
  --compile-commands build/compile_commands.json `
  --changed-since upstream/master `
  --dry-run

python tools/windows_build_preflight.py `
  --compile-commands build/compile_commands.json `
  --all-commands
```

## Coverage boundaries

The preflight does not compile CUDA translation units, perform general linker
resolution, generate optimized machine code, validate packaging, or exercise
runtime behavior. The DLL source rule catches the common missing-export case,
but it cannot prove that every library and executable will link. A successful
full Windows build and the relevant tests remain authoritative.

Include discovery is a lexical approximation: macro-generated includes and
ambiguous suffix matches are not resolved, and conditional branches are not
evaluated. Use the full build for definitive dependency coverage.

When no changed source or project header is reachable from the configured C/C++
graph, the tool reports that no affected translation unit was found. Use the
build directory for the configuration being validated, especially when
checking portable-only or optional code paths.
